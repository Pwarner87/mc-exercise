the birds were out, and bob is an avid bird watcher. Carol not so much, but she values the happieness of her coworkers and so she shared his entheuasim. Next week they will spend time on her passions, syncronized swimming. Bob ditched Carol and decided to hang out with Alice. They were on the beach and Bob fell in the water!
