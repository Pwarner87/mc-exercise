#bob and carol went on a lovely walk 
---
the birds were out, and bob is an avid bird watcher. Carol not so much, but she values the happieness of her coworkers and so she shared his entheuasim. Next week they will spend time on her passions, syncronized swimming. 

Ted, however, never went for walks - he was affraid of getting hit by bird excriment and lazy. During breaks he preferred to swim, behind carol. Ted didnt care about his co-workers emotional safety.
